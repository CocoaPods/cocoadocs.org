Hello there! A better README, and a bunch of real documentation is coming soon. Just not right here, right now.

Cocoadocs is a hold-all for objc documentation.

Currently it's ran from your computer, bundle install will install all the gems. But you probably don't have access to my s3 account so you'll want to disable that bit.

Infact it's currently very inelegant but it does the job of getting somewhere.
